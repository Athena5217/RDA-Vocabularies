We've been experimenting with a new json-ld format for the RDA Value Vocabularies that provides substantially more metadata describing the vocabulary itself as well as expanding the data available in the display of each vocabulary. Today we rolled that out on all of the Value Vocabulary documentation pages.

This also allows us to add the ability to sort by CURIE, Label, or Definition to the Values list, as well as a Vocabulary-specific Search box that also searches Definitions and Scope Notes. 

Last but not least, there's now an easy way to choose to display a Vocabulary in any of its available languages. The languages that you see that appear to be disabled are active Works-in-Progress.
